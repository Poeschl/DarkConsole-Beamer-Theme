# DarkConsole Beamer Theme [![Travis master](https://img.shields.io/travis/Poeschl/DarkConsole-Beamer-Theme/master.svg?maxAge=3600)](https://travis-ci.org/Poeschl/DarkConsole-Beamer-Theme)

This theme is latex beamer theme I often use for coding related presentations.
Its a modified version of the DarkConsole theme of Kazuki Maeda (<kmaeda@users.sourceforge.jp>), which is available [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/darkconsole-beamer-theme/yrqyrpvxzjvj).

It is adjusted to my personal color liking and prepared for german presentations.
For a closer look there is an example latex file ``Example_Presentation.tex`` which describes the functions of the included packages.
The compiled version as `.pdf` can be found in the release tab, seperated by versions.

### Needed packages
To be able to compile the presentation following packages besides the `latex beamer` package are needed:

* beamer
* xcolor
* pgf
* droid (a font)
* minted
* fvextra
* upquote
* slantsc
* ifplatform
* xstring
